It involves a 6-year old Tunisian boy that had presented with diffuse scaling of the scalp misdiagnosed as psoriasis and was treated unsuccessfully with keratolytic shampoos for two years. Tinea favosa due to Trichophyton schoenleinii was confirmed by mycological examination. He was successfully treated with griseofulvin for 6 weeks and topical application of imidazole. Trichophyton schoenleinii is an important anthropophilic dermatophyte that causes tinea favosa. It is transmitted by contagion between humans and is currently endemic in Africa. Ringworm is still frequent in Tunisia, but favus is becoming exceptional due to improvements in living conditions and hygiene.","authors":["Khaled, Aida","Ben Mbarek, Lilia","Kharfi, Monia","Zeglaoui, Faten","Bouratbine, Aida","Fazaa, Becima","Kamoun Barek, Mohamed Ridha"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T03:52:17+00:00","issns":["1318-4458"],"issue":"1","journal":"Acta dermatovenerologica Alpina, Pannonica, et Adriatica","links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/17992453"],"pmid":"17992453","pubdate":"2007-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","subjects":["dermatology","sexuallytransmitteddiseases"],"title":"Tinea capitis favosa due to Trichophyton schoenleinii.","type":"article","volume":"16","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/tinea-capitis-favosa-due-trichophyton-schoenleinii"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Student  > Ph.

However, few data are available currently concerning plasmacytoid dendritic cells (PDC), another type of innate immune cells. These cells are the main type I interferon (IFN) producing cells, but they also secrete other pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor or interleukin [IL]-6) or immunomodulatory factors (e.g., IL-10 or transforming growth factor-\u03b2). Through these functions, PDC participate in antimicrobial responses or maintenance of immune tolerance, and have been implicated in the pathophysiology of several autoimmune diseases. Recent data support the idea that the glycolytic pathway (or glycolysis), as well as lipid metabolism (including both cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism) may impact some innate immune functions of PDC or may be involved in these functions after Toll-like receptor (TLR) 7\/9 triggering. Some differences may be related to the origin of PDC (human versus mouse PDC or blood-sorted versus FLT3 ligand stimulated-bone marrow-sorted PDC). The kinetics of glycolysis may differ between human and murine PDC. In mouse PDC, metabolism changes promoted by TLR7\/9 activation may depend on an autocrine\/paracrine loop, implicating type I IFN and its receptor IFNAR, explaining a delayed glycolysis. Moreover, PDC functions can be modulated by the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids. This may occur via the production of lipid ligands that activate nuclear receptors (e.g., liver X receptor [LXR]) in PDC or through limiting intracellular cholesterol pool size (by statins or LXR agonists) in these cells. Finally, lipid-activated nuclear receptors ( i.e., LXR or peroxisome proliferator activated receptor) may also directly interact with pro-inflammatory transcription factors, such as NF-\u03baB. Here, we discuss how glycolysis and lipid metabolism may modulate PDC functions and how this may be harnessed in pathological situations where PDC play a detrimental role.","volume":"6","handles":[],"mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/recent-insights-implications-metabolism-plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-innate-functions-potential-ways","altmetric_jid":"55c212452a83ee1f7c8b4567","authors":["Philippe Saas","Alexis Varin","Sylvain Perruche","Adam Ceroi"],"pmid":"28580131","issns":["2046-1402"],"pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","journal":"F1000 Research","pmcid":"PMC5437952","last_mentioned_on":1496797687},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Dendritic cells","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/444106482712182784\/jm3fnA5u_normal.jpeg","tweeter_id":"2386845055","followers":323,"id_on_source":"DCell_papers","geo":{"ln":-2.23743,"country":"GB","lt":53.48095},"description":"Journal paper feed for academics interested in dendritic cells, immunology and immunity (image source: NIH)"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DCell_papers\/statuses\/872258836907741185","citation_ids":[20863733],"tweet_id":"872258836907741185","posted_on":"2017-06-07T01:08:07+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":1,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":376,"rank":1680,"total_number_of_other_articles":2444,"sample_size":2444,"percentile":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"mean":9.6877101924},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":2622063,"rank":7057405,"total_number_of_other_articles":11332694,"sample_size":11332694,"percentile":23,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"mean":7.2378161558},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":91705,"rank":150572,"total_number_of_other_articles":267219,"sample_size":267219,"percentile":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":34,"mean":12.921194942},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":33,"rank":93,"total_number_of_other_articles":135,"sample_size":135,"percentile":24,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":24,"mean":10.194358209}}},"selected_quotes":["Recent insights into the implications of metabolism in plasmacytoid dendritic cell innate functions: Potential ways\u2026"],"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["DCell_papers"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":26,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":20863733}

Questions were asked regarding antenatal vaccines, knowledge of GBS, attitudes to a potential future GBS vaccine and participation in antenatal vaccine trials.\nAll participants were very cautious about vaccination during pregnancy, with harm to the baby being a major concern. Despite this, the pregnant women and parents with experience of GBS were open to the idea of an antenatal GBS vaccine and participating in research, while the maternity professionals were less positive. Major barriers identified included lack of knowledge about GBS and the reluctance of maternity professionals to be involved.\nIn order for a future GBS vaccine to be acceptable to both pregnant women and the healthcare professionals advising them, a major awareness campaign would be required with significant focus on convincing and training maternity professionals.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Biological Sciences"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Agricultural And Veterinary Sciences"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Medical And Health Sciences"}],"volume":"34","subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f6100036ea","scopus_subjects":["Veterinary","Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Medicine","Immunology and Microbiology"],"mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/attitudes-towards-antenatal-vaccination-group-b-streptococcus-participation-clinical-trials-insights","authors":["McQuaid, Fiona","Pask, Sophie","Locock, Louise","Davis, Elizabeth","Stevens, Zoe","Plumb, Jane","Snape, Matthew D","Fiona McQuaid","Sophie Pask","Louise Locock","Elizabeth Davis","Zoe Stevens","Jane Plumb","Matthew D.

Ki-67 labeling rates (the percentage of Ki-67 positive cells in the total cells analyzed) greatly varied from patient to patient (0.0% approximately 49.2%). The mean value of the Ki-67 labeling rates was significantly higher in ALL than in ANLL (23.6% vs 5.6%, p < 0.001). In ALL, the Ki-67 labeling rates correlated with the proportion of S-phase cells determined by DNA flow cytometry (FCM) (r = 0.82) High Ki-67 labeling rates were preferably seen in ALL with favorable prognostic factors, although the correlation was not statistically significant. These results suggest that Ki-67 labeling rates reflect the differences in proliferative activity of bone marrow blast cells in childhood acute leukemia and is useful to determine the treatment schedule of cycle specific drugs.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9283cf058f61000dd1e","authors":["Ito, M","Tsurusawa, M","Kawai, S","Fujimoto, T"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T05:04:09+00:00","issns":["0485-1439"],"issue":"8","journal":"[Rinsh\u014d ketsueki] The Japanese journal of clinical hematology","links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/7563603"],"pmid":"7563603","pubdate":"1995-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["hematology"],"title":"[Expression of a proliferation associated-nuclear antigen defined by Ki-67 monoclonal antibody in childhood acute leukemia].","type":"article","volume":"36","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/expression-proliferation-associatednuclear-antigen-defined-ki67-monoclonal-antibody-childhood-acute"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Agricultural and Biological Sciences":1}}}},"posts":[]}

However, the literature has hardly highlighted such progress and the factors responsible for them. The current study uses Ghana as a case to examine progress in the consumption of reproductive health services over the last two decades and the factors responsible for such progress.\nThe study uses two rounds (1998 and 2014) of Demographic and Health Survey data from Ghana. Standard frequencies, a logit model and decomposition of the coefficients of the logit model (i.e. Oaxaca-type decomposition) was employed to examine changes in the use of reproductive health services (4+ antenatal visits and skilled attendance at birth) at national and sub-national levels (i.e the four ecological zones of Ghana) between 1998 and 2014 as well as factors explaining observed spatial changes between the two periods.\nDescriptive results suggest that the highest level of improvement occurred in resource-poor zones (i.e. northern belt followed by the southern belt) compared to the middle belt and Greater Accra, where access to resources and infrastructure is relatively better. Results from Oaxaca-type decomposition also suggest that women and partner's education, household wealth and availability and accessibility to health facilities are the key factors explaining spatial variation in reproductive health service consumption over the two periods. Most importantly, the marginal efficiency of investment in women and partner's education and access to health services were highest in the two resource poor zones.\nThere is the need to target resource poor settings with existing or new pro-poor reproductive health interventions. Specifically, the northern and southern zones where the key drivers of education and availability of health facilities are the lowest, will be key to further improvements in the consumption of reproductive health services in Ghana.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d5","authors":["Gordon Abekah-Nkrumah"],"doi":"10.1186\/s12884-018-1695-3","first_seen_on":"2018-03-06T23:32:47+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["1471-2393"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth","last_mentioned_on":1520379142,"links":["https:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1186\/s12884-018-1695-3"],"pdf_url":"https:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1186%2Fs12884-018-1695-3.pdf","pmcid":"PMC5838884","pmid":"29510675","pubdate":"2018-03-06T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"BioMed Central","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Paediatrics And Reproductive Medicine","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Nursing","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["obstetrics"],"title":"Spatial variation in the use of reproductive health services over time: a decomposition analysis","type":"article","volume":"18","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/spatial-variation-reproductive-health-services-time-decomposition-analysis"},"altmetric_score":{"score":5.08,"score_history":{"1y":5.08,"6m":5.08,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":5.08},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":11275925,"mean":7.2346236746437,"rank":2436102,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":78,"this_scored_higher_than":8810064,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":11275925,"percentile":78},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":252857,"mean":13.714250031638,"rank":70594,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":71,"this_scored_higher_than":180679,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":252857,"percentile":71},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1978,"mean":7.1254446130501,"rank":643,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":1301,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1978,"percentile":65},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":60,"mean":8.4345762711864,"rank":34,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":23,"this_scored_higher_than":14,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":60,"percentile":23}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Nursing and Health Professions":1}}}},"posts":{"blogs":[{"title":"Spatial variation in the use of reproductive health services over time: a decomposition analysis","url":"http:\/\/ifp.nyu.edu\/2018\/open-access-journal-articles\/s12884-018-1695-3\/","license":"public","citation_ids":[34015163],"posted_on":"2018-03-06T23:32:22+00:00","summary":"Abstract\n                    \nBackground\nThe paper argues that several Sub-Saharan African countries have recorded marked improvements in the use of reproductive health services.

The sperm whale (Physeter macrocephalus) is an emerging aquatic model for both human disease and ocean health having global distribution and high trophic level. The aim of this study was to establish global and regional baselines of total arsenic concentrations using free-ranging sperm whales. Skin biopsies (n=342) were collected during the voyage of the Odyssey (2000-2005) from 17 regions considering gender and age in males. Arsenic was detectable in 99% of samples with a global mean of 1.9\u03bcg\/g ww ranging from 0.1 to 15.6\u03bcg\/g ww. Previous work in toothed whale skin found mean concentrations 3 fold lower with 0.6\u03bcg\/g ww. A significant gender-related effect was found with males having higher mean arsenic concentrations than females. There was no significant age-related effect between adult and subadult males. Arsenic concentrations in sloughed skin samples were similar to levels in skin biopsies indicating that arsenic excretion can occur by skin sloughing. Regional mean concentrations were highest in the Maldives, Seychelles and Sri Lanka with 3.5, 2.5, and 2.4\u03bcg\/g ww, respectively, raising concern for arsenic pollution in the Indian Ocean. Literature suggests that arsenic exposure is emitted from natural sources and the heavy use of arsenic-containing pesticides and herbicides in this region. These data suggest that research is needed in determining the extent and source of arsenic pollution in the Indian Ocean.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Biological Sciences"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Environmental Sciences"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Medical And Health Sciences"}],"scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/global-assessment-arsenic-pollution-using-sperm-whales-physeter-macrocephalus-emerging-aquatic-model","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4ea3cf058f6100025b5","abstract_source":"pubmed","pmid":"24473067","issns":["15320456"],"type":"article","journal":"Comparative Biochemistry & Physiology Part C: Toxicology & Pharmacology","last_mentioned_on":1426109477},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"datasift","author":{"name":"YaleSPH","url":"http:\/\/publichealth.yale.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/935256321234034690\/YZN9jfbN_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"86964484","followers":4764,"id_on_source":"YaleSPH","geo":{"ln":17,"country":"LY","lt":28},"description":"This is the official Twitter feed for the Yale School of Public Health."},"url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/YaleSPH\/status\/575770995568549889","citation_ids":[2094578],"tweet_id":"575770995568549889","posted_on":"2015-03-11T21:31:17+00:00"},{"license":"public","author":{"name":"YaleSPH","url":"http:\/\/publichealth.yale.edu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/935256321234034690\/YZN9jfbN_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"86964484","followers":4764,"id_on_source":"YaleSPH","geo":{"ln":17,"country":"LY","lt":28},"description":"This is the official Twitter feed for the Yale School of Public Health."},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/YaleSPH\/status\/430390306023153665","citation_ids":[2094578],"tweet_id":"430390306023153665","posted_on":"2014-02-03T17:20:19+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":105,"total_number_of_other_articles":152,"sample_size":152,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":1.7754701987},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":4066054,"total_number_of_other_articles":4859554,"sample_size":4859554,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":5.790534594},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":110029,"total_number_of_other_articles":135369,"sample_size":135369,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":7.8744509781},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":1,"total_number_of_other_articles":2,"sample_size":2,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":0.25}}},"selected_quotes":["Global assessment of #arsenic pollution using #sperm whales.","Global Assessment of #Arsenic Pollution Using Sperm #Whales #environmentalhealth"],"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":2,"unique_users":["YaleSPH"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":2},"readers":{"mendeley":39,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":2094578}

Though the problem is widespread, few studies have examined the effect of a lifestyle intervention in pregnancy designed to limit maternal weight gain. The Fit for Delivery study will explore the effectiveness of nutritional counseling coupled with exercise classes compared with standard prenatal care. The aims of the study are to examine the effect of the intervention on maternal weight gain, newborn birth weight, glucose regulation, complications of pregnancy and delivery, and maternal weight retention up to 12 months postpartum.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"springer","name":"Biostatistics"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Environmental Health"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Epidemiology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Medicine & Public Health"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Medicine\/Public Health, general"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Public Health"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Vaccine"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Public Health And Health Services"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"volume":"13","subjects":["publichealth"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007d8","abstract_source":"pubmed","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/study-protocol-fit-delivery-lifestyle-intervention-pregnancy-result-measurable-health-benefits-mothe","pmid":"23406306","issns":["1471-2458"],"issue":"1","journal":"BMC Public Health","pubdate":"2013-02-13T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1366533314},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"public","author":{"name":"Tom ","url":"http:\/\/q.gs\/1dO4b","image":"http:\/\/a0.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1502479355\/png500_normal.PNG","tweeter_id":"32391572","followers":21006,"id_on_source":"megasimplediet","geo":{"ln":-76.609264,"country":"US","lt":39.290585},"description":"Try the other diets if you want, then do mine.

By combining 3 treatment stages-maxillary expansion, crown exposure surgery, and induced eruption-the horizontally impacted incisor was successfully moved into proper position. The patient finished treatment with a normal and stable occlusion between the maxillary and mandibular arches, and an adequate width of attached gingiva, even in the area surrounding the crown. The 5-year follow-up of stability and periodontal health demonstrated esthetic and functional outcomes after orthodontically induced tooth eruption. Clinical evaluation showed that the treated central incisor had periodontal clinical variables related to visible plaque, bleeding on probing, width of attached gingiva, and crown length that resembled the contralateral incisor.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e53cf058f610005711","authors":["Rizzatto, Susana Maria Deon","de Menezes, Luciane Macedo","Allgayer, Susiane","Batista, Eraldo Luiz","Freitas, Maria Perp\u00c3\u00a9tua Mota","Loro, Raphael Carlos Drumond"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.ajodo.2012.08.028","first_seen_on":"2013-07-23T08:32:18+00:00","issns":["0889-5406"],"journal":"American Journal of Orthodontics & Dentofacial Orthopedics","last_mentioned_on":1374487248,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S088954061300293X"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.ajodo.org\/article\/S0889-5406(13)00293-X\/pdf","pmid":"23810053","pubdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Dentistry","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biomedical Engineering","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Dentistry","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["orthodontics","dentistry"],"title":"Orthodontically induced eruption of a horizontally impacted maxillary central incisor","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/orthodontically-induced-eruption-horizontally-impacted-maxillary-central-incisor"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3630679,"mean":4.9289340563991,"rank":2899288,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":79801,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3630679,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":85734,"mean":7.4064751729208,"rank":68324,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":350,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":85734,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":299,"mean":2.1475234899329,"rank":205,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":8,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":299,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"mean":0.5,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":5,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Librarian":1,"Researcher":4,"Student  > Doctoral Student":5,"Student  > Ph.

They have also created systems which combine elements of these approaches. While governance of plant and animal genetic resources is well-established internationally, there has not yet been a clear approach selected for human genetic resources. Based on assessment of the goals which international governance of human genetic resources ought to serve, and the implications for how they will be accessed and utilised, it is argued that common heritage of mankind will be the most appropriate approach to adopt to their ownership\/control. It does this with the aim of stimulating discussion in this area and providing a starting point for deeper consideration of how a common heritage of mankind, or similar, regime for human genetic resources would function and be implemented.","first_seen_on":"2016-08-26T15:05:19+00:00","pubdate":"2015-08-22T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Potential International Approaches to Ownership\/Control of Human Genetic Resources","scopus_subjects":["Nursing","Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Medicine"],"subjects":["healthservices","publichealth"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa61a3cf058f6100075e6","startpage":"260","pmid":"26297608","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/potential-international-approaches-ownershipcontrol-human-genetic-resources","last_mentioned_on":1472223904,"journal":"Health Care Analysis","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"springer","name":"Ethics"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Health Informatics"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Medicine & Public Health"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Philosophy of Medicine"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Public Health"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Public Health And Health Services"}],"volume":"24","authors":["Catherine Rhodes"],"endpage":"277","publisher":"Springer US","doi":"10.1007\/s10728-015-0300-4","issue":"3","pdf_url":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/content\/pdf\/10.1007%2Fs10728-015-0300-4.pdf","uri":"http:\/\/link.springer.com\/10.1007\/s10728-015-0300-4","issns":["1573-3394","1065-3058"]},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Springer Public Health","url":"http:\/\/www.springer.com\/public+health","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1596209687\/SpringerTw_dblue_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"394023839","followers":1959,"id_on_source":"SpringerPBH","geo":{"ln":-75.4999,"country":"US","lt":43.00035},"description":"SpringerPBH brings you #PublicHealth news from #Springer, one of the world's largest publishers of STM books, journals, and reference works."},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SpringerPBH\/statuses\/769188920441438208","citation_ids":[10846920],"tweet_id":"769188920441438208","posted_on":"2016-08-26T15:05:04+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.5,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":6,"rank":127,"total_number_of_other_articles":161,"sample_size":161,"percentile":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":3,"mean":3.6999875},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":1120194,"rank":6284173,"total_number_of_other_articles":8282830,"sample_size":8282830,"percentile":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"mean":6.9841686086},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":40023,"rank":179726,"total_number_of_other_articles":252872,"sample_size":252872,"percentile":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"mean":12.3768650102},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":1,"rank":4,"total_number_of_other_articles":5,"sample_size":5,"percentile":20,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":20,"mean":8.5375}}},"selected_quotes":["Potential International Approaches to Ownership\/Control of Human Genetic Resources, in new Health Care Analysis"],"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["SpringerPBH"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":5,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":10846920}

This persistent biology may pose challenges to effective antibiotic treatment. Experimental studies in dogs, mice, and non-human primates have found persistence of B. burgdorferi DNA following treatment with a variety of antibiotics, but persisting spirochetes are non-cultivable. Persistence of B. burgdorferi DNA has been documented in humans following treatment, but the significance remains unknown. The present study utilized a ceftriaxone treatment regimen in the C3H mouse model that resulted in persistence of non-cultivable B. burgdorferi in order to determine their long-term fate, and to examine their effects on the host. Results confirmed previous studies, in which B. burgdorferi could not be cultured from tissues, but low copy numbers of B. burgdorferi flaB DNA were detectable in tissues at 2, 4 and 8 months after completion of treatment, and the rate of PCR-positive tissues appeared to progressively decline over time. However, there was resurgence of spirochete flaB DNA in multiple tissues at 12 months, with flaB DNA copy levels nearly equivalent to those found in saline-treated mice. Despite the continued non-cultivable state, RNA transcription of multiple B. burgdorferi genes was detected in host tissues, flaB DNA was acquired by xenodiagnostic ticks, and spirochetal forms could be visualized within ticks and mouse tissues by immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry, respectively. A number of host cytokines were up- or down-regulated in tissues of both saline- and antibiotic-treated mice in the absence of histopathology, indicating host response to the presence of non-cultivable, despite the lack of inflammation in tissues.","abstract_source":"pubmed","last_mentioned_on":1528040922,"pubdate":"2014-01-23T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Resurgence of Persisting Non-Cultivable  Borrelia burgdorferi  following Antibiotic Treatment in Mice","scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences","Medicine"],"handles":[],"subjects":["medicine","science"],"startpage":"e86907","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5313cf058f6100043e3","pmid":"24466286","issue":"1","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/resurgence-persisting-noncultivable-borrelia-burgdorferi-following-antibiotic-treatment-mice","first_seen_on":"2014-01-24T02:41:00+00:00","journal":"PLoS ONE","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Multidisciplinary"}],"volume":"9","authors":["Emir Hodzic","Denise Imai","Sunlian Feng","Stephen W.

Although genera in each group of fungi were carefully considered, some competing generic names were overlooked. This paper makes recommendations for additional competing genera not considered in previous papers. Chairs of relevant Working Groups of the ICTF were consulted in the development of these recommendations. A number of generic names need protection, specifically Amarenographium over Amarenomyces, Amniculicola over Anguillospora, Balansia over Ephelis, Claviceps over Sphacelia, Drepanopeziza over Gloeosporidiella and Gloeosporium, Golovinomyces over Euoidium, Holwaya over Crinium, Hypocrella over Aschersonia, Labridella over Griphosphaerioma, Metacapnodium over Antennularia, and Neonectria over Cylindrocarpon and Heliscus. The following new combinations are made: Amniculicola longissima, Atichia maunauluana, Diaporthe columnaris, D. liquidambaris, D. longiparaphysata, D. palmicola, D. tersa, Elsino\u00eb bucidae, E.caricae, E. choisyae, E. paeoniae, E. psidii, E. zorniae, Eupelte shoemakeri, Godronia myrtilli, G. raduloides, Sarcinella mirabilis, S. pulchra, Schizothyrium jamaicense, and Trichothallus niger. Finally, one new species name, Diaporthe azadirachte, is introduced to validate an earlier name, and the conservation of Discula with a new type, D. destructiva, is recommended.","altmetric_jid":"56c1ef722a83ee09648b518a","authors":["Amy Y.

Current opinion is that LCH cells are likely to arise from hematopoietic precursor cells, although the stage of derailment and site of transformation remain unclear and may vary in patients with different extent of disease. Over the years, evidence has provided the view that LCH is a neoplasm. The demonstration of clonality of LCH cells, insufficient evidence alone for neoplasia, is now bolstered by finding driver somatic mutations in BRAF in up to 55% of patients with LCH, and activation of the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK (where MEK and ERK are mitogen-activated protein kinase and extracellular signal-regulated kinase, respectively) pathway in nearly 100% of patients with LCH. Herein, we review the evidence that recurrent genetic abnormalities characterized by activating oncogenic mutations should satisfy prerequisites for LCH to be called a neoplasm. As a consequence, recurrent episodes of LCH should be considered relapsed disease rather than disease reactivation.
