The aim of this paper is to develop a system that automatically captures a hundred microscopic images of pollen and classifies them into the 12 different species from Lagunera Region, Mexico. Many times, the pollen is overlapping on the microscopic images, which increases the difficulty for its automated identification and classification. This paper focuses on a method to segment the overlapping pollen. First, the proposed method segments the overlapping pollen. Second, the method separates the pollen based on the mean shift process (100% segmentation) and erosion by H-minima based on the Fibonacci series. Thus, pollen is characterized by its shape, color, and texture for training and evaluating the performance of three classification techniques: random tree forest, multilayer perceptron, and Bayes net. Using the newly developed system, we obtained segmentation results of 100% and classification on top of 96.2% and 96.1% in recall and precision using multilayer perceptron in twofold cross validation.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Applied Mathematics"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Biomedical Engineering"}],"volume":"2016","subjects":["medicalinformatics"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5223cf058f610003acc","scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Physical Sciences","Medicine","Mathematics","Immunology and Microbiology"],"mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/novel-method-separation-overlapping-pollen-species-automated-detection-classification","authors":["Tello-Mijares, Santiago","Flores, Francisco"],"startpage":"1","pmid":"27034710","issns":["1748-6718","1748-670X"],"type":"article","journal":"Computational & Mathematical Methods in Medicine","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","endpage":"12"},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Florin-Dan Popescu","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/979667610303451136\/93SKgauE_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"1423225123","followers":8482,"id_on_source":"FlorinDanPopesc","geo":{"ln":null,"lt":null},"description":"Social Media Editor for @EAACI_HQ Allergist, Assoc.Professor,MD,PhD, Tweets\/RTweets\u2260medical advice, Following\/RTweets\u2260endorsement, Opinions mine & others(cited)"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/FlorinDanPopesc\/statuses\/717828588419092480","citation_ids":[6506673],"tweet_id":"717828588419092480","posted_on":"2016-04-06T21:37:26+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":192,"total_number_of_other_articles":284,"sample_size":284,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":1.5111943463},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":7109025,"total_number_of_other_articles":8214888,"sample_size":8214888,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":6.9557961245},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":233742,"total_number_of_other_articles":276599,"sample_size":276599,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":11.4218289142},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":5,"total_number_of_other_articles":6,"sample_size":6,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":1.69}}},"selected_quotes":["Novel Method for Separation of Overlapping Pollen Species for Automated Detection Classification #WorldAllergyWeek"],"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["FlorinDanPopesc"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":8,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":6506673}

Patients were divided into 2 groups; group A were treated with 100 millicurie (mCi) and group B with \u2265150 mCi. Databases were reviewed for demographics, diagnosis, and administered dosage of I-131. Whole body scintigraphy images were retrieved and nasal uptake was analyzed and classified as nil to trace, low, moderate, and high uptake and corresponding single photon emission CTs were analyzed for radioactive nasal activity.\nA total of 100 patients were studied, 50 in each of the groups. The M:F ratio was 1.1:1 (27:23) in group A and 1.5:1 (30:20) in group B. The mean age was 43.12 years and 54.6 years in groups A and B, respectively. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid was the most common type accounting for 82% (41\/50) of patients in group A and 62% (31\/50) in group B. Imaging studies revealed nil to trace nasal activity in 80% (40\/50) in group A as compared with 56% (28\/50) in group B. None of the patients in group A showed high nasal uptake, whereas 4% (2\/50) in group B demonstrated such high activity.\nIntranasal localization of radioactive I-131 was significant in patients receiving a dose of \u2265150 mCi. Intranasal localization may partly explain toxicity to nasolacrimal duct and may be a risk factor for subsequent development of nasolacrimal duct obstructions.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6303cf058f6100083ca","authors":["Ali, Mohammad Javed","Vyakaranam, Achyut Ram","Rao, Jyotsna Eleshwarapu","Prasad, Giri","Reddy, Palkonda Vijay Anand"],"doi":"10.1097\/iop.0000000000000603","first_seen_on":"2017-03-12T02:33:50+00:00","issns":["0740-9303"],"issue":"1","journal":"Ophthalmic Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery","last_mentioned_on":1488917148,"links":["http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Iodine_131_Therapy_and_Lacrimal_Drainage_System.3.aspx"],"pdf_url":"http:\/\/pdfs.journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/2017\/01000\/Iodine_131_Therapy_and_Lacrimal_Drainage_System.3.pdf","pmid":"26669292","pubdate":"2017-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher":"LWW","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Ophthalmology And Optometry","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"startpage":"13","subjects":["ophthalmology","generalsurgery"],"title":"Iodine-131 Therapy and Lacrimal Drainage System Toxicity","type":"article","uri":"http:\/\/journals.lww.com\/op-rs\/Fulltext\/2017\/01000\/Iodine_131_Therapy_and_Lacrimal_Drainage_System.3.aspx","volume":"33","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/iodine131-therapy-lacrimal-drainage-system-toxicity-nasal-localization-studies-using-whole-body-nucl"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9159176,"mean":7.5156893021349,"rank":7940478,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9159176,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":253440,"mean":13.82762456449,"rank":214220,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":253440,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":684,"mean":1.0980702781845,"rank":465,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":684,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":15,"mean":0.36428571428571,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":15,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":2,"Student  > Ph.

However, no knowledge exists about toxoplasmosis, an emergent disease in military personnel. We compared the prevalence of IgG anti-Toxoplasma antibodies by ELISA and of parasitaemia by a real time PCR assay, in 500 professional soldiers that operated in the jungle with a group of 501 soldiers working in an urban zone (Bogot\u00e1). We found that the prevalence was significantly different between both groups of soldiers (80% in soldiers operating in jungle vs. 45% in urban soldiers, adjusted OR 11.4; CI 95%: 3.8-34; p<0.0001). All soldiers operating in the jungle drink unboiled and chlorine untreated lake or river water. In urban soldiers, these risk factors along with eating wild animal meat or eating tigrillo (little spotted cat) were significantly associated with a higher prevalence. Characteristic toxoplasmic choriorretinal lesions were found in 4 soldiers that operated in the jungle (0.8%) and in one urban soldier (0.19%). All soldiers before being deployed in jungle operations should be tested for Toxoplasma antibodies and to receive adequate health information about the routine use of personnel filters to purify their water for consumption.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f610002168","doi":"10.1016\/j.actatropica.2011.11.019","first_seen_on":"2011-12-16T08:42:31+00:00","issns":["0001706X"],"journal":"Acta Tropica","last_mentioned_on":1323778683,"links":["http:\/\/www.sciencedirect.com\/science\/article\/pii\/S0001706X11003457"],"pmid":"22178449","pubdate":"2011-12-09T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Medical And Health Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Medicine","Immunology and Microbiology"],"title":"Toxoplasmosis in military personnel involved in jungle operations","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/toxoplasmosis-military-personnel-involved-jungle-operations"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0.25},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3631967,"mean":4.9253635474614,"rank":2898474,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":80984,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3631967,"percentile":2},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":229513,"mean":3.9050496793199,"rank":164131,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":916,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":229513,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":434,"mean":1.8636304849885,"rank":317,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":2,"this_scored_higher_than":12,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":434,"percentile":2},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":12,"mean":2.6090909090909,"rank":7,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":12,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":2,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.

This means a more rapid growth of the elderly U.S. population in general, and of the \"oldest-old\" population in particular. Thus it is of considerable social and health policy interest to forecast the direction and magnitude of future changes in life expectancy at later ages and the changes in the prevalence of health and disability at later ages consequent to the increases in life expectancy. In the analysis, several prior efforts to predict life expectancy changes using standard demographic techniques are reviewed and reasons for the limitations of such efforts suggested. Results show that mortality changes at advanced ages have very different relations to risk factors than at earlier ages. The analysis also shows that linking morbidity, disability, and mortality in a complete projection of population health changes will require the extension of standard demographic methodologies to utilize information from multiple data sources.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f53cf058f610002dc3","authors":["Manton, K G","Kenneth G.

The causes for the formation of most urinary calculi remain poorly understood, but obtaining the chemical composition of these stones might help identify key aspects of this process and new targets for treatment. The majority of urinary stones are composed of calcium that is complexed in a crystalline matrix with organic and inorganic components. Surprisingly, mitigation of urolithiasis risk by altering calcium homeostasis has not been very effective. Thus, studies to identify other therapeutic stone-specific targets, using proteomics, metabolomics and microscopy techniques, have been conducted, revealing a high level of complexity. The data suggest that numerous metals other than calcium and many nonmetals are present within calculi at measurable levels and several have distinct distribution patterns. Manipulation of the levels of some of these elemental components of calcium-based stones has resulted in clinically beneficial changes in stone chemistry and rate of stone formation.

A significant increase (31%) was found among people aged greater than or less than 45, but this is not thought to be reliable. The increase among women alone (21%) was significant with a one tailed test. Contrary to expectations there was a positive association between trends in overdose and distance from London--that is, the further the distance of the region from London the greater the increase in cases of overdose during the experimental period--and a negative association between trends in overdose and viewing figures--that is, the higher the viewing figure the less the impact on the incidence of overdoses. These findings do not lend support to the claim that there was a strong imitation effect after this televised parasuicide.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e93cf058f61000245c","authors":["Platt, S"],"first_seen_on":"2017-05-08T16:57:20+00:00","issns":["0267-0623"],"issue":"6577","journal":"British Medical Journal","last_mentioned_on":1494242100,"links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/3107671"],"pmcid":"PMC1246010","pmid":"3107671","pubdate":"1987-04-11T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Public Health And Health Services","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["medicine"],"title":"The aftermath of Angie's overdose: is soap (opera) damaging to your health?","type":"article","volume":"294"},"altmetric_score":{"score":10,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":10},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9782970,"mean":7.5559344894062,"rank":1046972,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":88,"this_scored_higher_than":8696861,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9782970,"percentile":88},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":264192,"mean":12.855200661642,"rank":43636,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":83,"this_scored_higher_than":219620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":264192,"percentile":83},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":37176,"mean":25.818774229993,"rank":12854,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":64,"this_scored_higher_than":24135,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":37176,"percentile":64},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":889,"mean":62.036970720721,"rank":443,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"this_scored_higher_than":445,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":889,"percentile":50}}},"demographics":[],"posts":{"news":[{"title":"13 Reasons Why and Suicide Contagion","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=30497701712&p=1pl&v=1&x=M1KyGvGOp3IZ0TbVn8RyxA","license":"public","citation_ids":[19959864,19959865,19959868],"posted_on":"2017-05-08T11:15:00+00:00","summary":"The Netflix series, 13 Reasons Why, has caused a furor.

This study investigated how trauma shapes the way that we remember personal experiences. Specifically, we investigated overgeneral autobiographical memory, which is the tendency to remember autobiographical events in an overgeneral rather than specific way. We administered the Autobiographical Memory Test (Williams & Broadbent,) to 86 survivors of political imprisonment 37 years after they had been released from imprisonment. Depression and posttraumatic stress disorder were not significantly related to overgeneral autobiographical memory. Significant overgeneral autobiographical memory correlates included embitterment, r = -.28, and being released to former East Germany, d = 0.67. Survivors with social support, r = .30 were better able to recall specific memories. Certain trauma characteristics and the way the trauma is processed may thus influence how personal memories are later remembered. This study also furthers the understanding of memory processes in political prisoners, who are not commonly studied in psychological research.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Psychology"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Social Sciences","Psychology","Medicine"],"subjects":["psychology"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f73cf058f610002f83","abstract_source":"pubmed","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/impact-imprisonment-overgeneral-autobiographical-memory-former-political-prisoners","authors":["Birgit Kleim","James W Griffith","Ira G\u00e4bler","Matthias Sch\u00fctzwohl","Andreas Maercker"],"pmid":"24114806","issns":["1573-6598"],"type":"article","journal":"Journal of Traumatic Stress","pubdate":"2013-09-23T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1382677826},"posts":{"twitter":[{"rt":["uzh_news_en"],"license":"datasift","author":{"name":"Health Literacy","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/731064960\/LiteracyII_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"77314206","followers":6060,"id_on_source":"Hlth_Literacy","geo":{"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US","lt":21.30694},"description":"Eclectic health info, Health Literacy  Also @HIV_Insight @Prison_Health, @Why_We_Do_That, @Sex_Worker_Hlth"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/Hlth_Literacy\/status\/393605450056617984","citation_ids":[1850212],"tweet_id":"393605450056617984","posted_on":"2013-10-25T05:10:26+00:00"},{"rt":["uzh_news_en"],"license":"public","author":{"name":"Why_We_Do_That","url":"http:\/\/hiv-insight.blogspot.com\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/779459146\/Rorschach_4_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"127024202","followers":1272,"id_on_source":"Why_We_Do_That","geo":{"ln":-157.85833,"country":"US","lt":21.30694},"description":"Psychology; how, why & what not.

Contrary to the idea that childhood bullying is a normal part of growing up or a rite of passage, it is now correlated with adolescent suicidality. An integrative review of the contemporary, extant literature was conducted to examine the following question: Are adolescents who have been involved in childhood bullying or cyberbullying as victim, offender, or victim\/offender at greater risk for suicidality than those who have not. It is important to empower school nurses with current and evidence-based information regarding childhood bullying and examine empirical science and tools to effectively address the current serious problem of adolescent suicide risk assessment and intervention.","abstract_source":"pubmed","first_seen_on":"2012-10-24T11:01:22+00:00","endpage":"283","title":"Examining Childhood Bullying and Adolescent Suicide Implications for School Nurses","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Nursing"],"subjects":["nursing","healthservices"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e93cf058f610005aa8","startpage":"275","pmid":"22333524","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/examining-childhood-bullying-adolescent-suicide-implications-school-nurses","last_mentioned_on":1396904717,"journal":"Journal of School Nursing (Allen Press Publishing Services Inc.)","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Nursing"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Specialist Studies In Education"}],"volume":"28","authors":["Karyn E.

It is a major cause of cancer death in Europe and North America. Matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors play an important role in tumor progression. MMPs are able to degrade basement membrane and extracellular matrix and are associated with tumor progression, including invasion, metastasis, growth, migration, and angiogenesis. Some clinical investigations have demonstrated the role of increased MMP expression in several human malignancies, their levels also correlating with tumor stage, invasiveness, and poor survival of patients with pancreatic cancer.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9113cf058f61000cc82","authors":["\u0141ukaszewicz, Marta","Mroczko, Barbara","Szmitkowski, Maciej"],"first_seen_on":"2017-07-28T04:31:23+00:00","issns":["1732-2693"],"journal":"Post\u0229py higieny i medycyny do\u015bwiadczalnej","links":["https:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/18414340"],"pmid":"18414340","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["publichealth","medicine","allergyandimmunology"],"title":"[The role of metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in pancreatic cancer].","type":"article","volume":"62","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rola-metaloproteinaz-i-ich-inhibitor%C3%B3w-w-raku-trzustki"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Researcher":1},"by_discipline":{"Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology":1}}}},"posts":[]}
