Like most fungi, thermophilic Myceliophthora species therefore have a large set of enzymes targeting different linkages in plant polysaccharides. The majority of these enzymes have not been functionally characterized, and their role in plant biomass degradation is unknown. The biotechnological challenge is to select the right set of enzymes to efficiently degrade a particular biomass. This study describes a strategy using sexual crossing and screening with the thermophilic fungus Myceliophthora heterothallica to identify specific enzymes associated with improved sugar beet pulp saccharification.\nTwo genetically diverse M. heterothallica strains CBS 203.75 and CBS 663.74 were used to generate progenies with improved growth on sugar beet pulp. One progeny, named SBP.F1.2.11, had a different genetic pattern from the parental strains and had improved saccharification activity after the growth on 3\u00a0% sugar beet pulp. The improved SBP saccharification was not explained by altered activities of the major (hemi-)cellulases. Exo-proteome analysis of progeny and parental strains after 7-day growth on sugar beet pulp showed that only 17 of the 133 secreted CAZy enzymes were more abundant in progeny SBP.F1.2.11. Particularly one enzyme belonging to the carbohydrate esterase family 5 (CE5) was more abundant in SBP.F1.2.11. This CE5-CBM1 enzyme, named as Axe1, was phylogenetically related to acetyl xylan esterases. Biochemical characterization of Axe1 confirmed de-acetylation activity with optimal activities at 75-85\u00a0\u00b0C and pH 5.5-6.0. Supplementing Axe1 to CBS 203.75 enzyme set improved release of xylose and glucose from sugar beet pulp.\nThis study identified beneficial enzymes for sugar beet pulp saccharification by selecting progeny with improved growth on this particular substrate. Saccharification of sugar beet pulp was improved by supplementing enzyme mixtures with a previously uncharacterized CE5-CBM1 acetyl xylan esterase. This shows that sexual crossing and selection of M. heterothallica are the successful strategy to improve the composition of enzyme mixtures for efficient plant biomass degradation.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Chemical Engineering"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Industrial Biotechnology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Biotechnology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Chemistry"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Environmental Engineering\/Biotechnology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Microbiology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Plant Breeding\/Biotechnology"},{"scheme":"springer","name":"Renewable and Green Energy"}],"volume":"9","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/sexual-crossing-thermophilic-fungus-myceliophthora-heterothallica-improved-enzymatic-degradation-sug","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4d03cf058f6100007e9","scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Energy"],"authors":["Aguilar-Pontes, Maria Victoria","Zhou, Miaomiao","van der Horst, Sjors","Theelen, Bart","de Vries, Ronald P","van den Brink, Joost"],"pmid":"26900400","issns":["1754-6834"],"type":"article","journal":"Biotechnology for Biofuels","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1456341974},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"yeast_papers","url":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Yeast","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/470859351591092225\/S4XxHSFa_normal.jpeg","tweeter_id":"2524594183","followers":1183,"id_on_source":"yeast_papers","geo":{"ln":-1.67429,"country":"FR","lt":48.11198},"description":"Get your fresh daily #yeast #papers from #Pubmed, #Arxiv, #BioRxiv and #PeerJ here!

Local anesthetics such as procaine and tetracaine, and an antihistaminic with local anesthetic activity, diphenhydramine, were studied for comparison. Increasing concentrations of cypropheptadine, starting from 5 x 10(-5) M, produced a dose-related fall in the amplitude of the compound action potential of the vagus nerve without significant change in the resting membrane potential. A complete reversibility of the local anesthetic effect was difficult or impossible to obtain when doses greater than 1 x 10(-4) M were used. Cyproheptadine was more potent than procaine and diphenhydramine, and less potent than tetracaine in producing nerve conduction block. Frequency-dependent block was observed with cyproheptadine and the other agents at frequencies that can be considered low (1--5 Hz). Myelinated fibres of the sciatic nerves were also blocked by cyproheptadine within the same range of concentrations (1 x 10(-4) to 1 x 10(-3) M). Our results provide an additional explanation for the mechanism underlying the actions of cyproheptadine as an antiarrhythmic and an antipruritic agent.","abstract_source":"pubmed","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000284e","authors":["F Riccioppo Neto"],"first_seen_on":"2015-02-05T22:41:05+00:00","handles":[],"isbns":[],"issns":["0014-2999"],"issue":"3","journal":"European Journal of Pharmacology","links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/428422"],"pmid":"428422","pubdate":"1979-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","scopus_subjects":["Life Sciences","Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutics"],"subjects":["pharmacology"],"title":"The local anesthetic effect of cyproheptadine on mammalian nerve fibres.","type":"article","volume":"54","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/local-anesthetic-effect-cyproheptadine-mammalian-nerve-fibres"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":3991275,"mean":5.0366419655303,"rank":3893645,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":3991275,"percentile":1},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":124080,"mean":9.0059835423452,"rank":123746,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":124080,"percentile":1},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1859,"mean":2.2547614431879,"rank":1724,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1859,"percentile":1},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":36,"mean":1.4557142857143,"rank":36,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":36,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Student  > Postgraduate":1,"Student  > Master":1},"by_discipline":{"Materials Science":1,"Pharmacology, Toxicology and Pharmaceutical Science":1}}}},"posts":[]}

Here, we used kainic acid-induced rat epilepsy model to investigate whether Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway is involved in the aberrant neurogenesis in temporal lobe epilepsy. Immunostaining and western blotting results showed that the expression levels of \u03b2-catenin, Wnt3a, and cyclin D1, the key regulators in Wnt signalling pathway, were up-regulated during acute epilepsy induced by the injection of kainic acids, indicating that Wnt signalling pathway was activated in kainic acid-induced temporal lobe epilepsy. Moreover, BrdU labelling results showed that blockade of the Wnt signalling by knocking down \u03b2-catenin attenuated aberrant neurogenesis induced by kainic acids injection. Altogether, Wnt\/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway mediated hippocampal neurogenesis during epilepsy, which might provide new strategies for clinical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy. Temporal lobe epilepsy is a chronic disorder of nerve system, mainly characterized by hippocampal sclerosis. Aberrant neurogenesis has been shown to involve in the epileptogenesis process of temporal lobe epilepsy. In the present study, we discovered that Wnt3a\/\u03b2-catenin signalling pathway serves as a link between aberrant neurogenesis and underlying remodelling in the hippocampus, leading to temporal lobe epilepsy, which might provide new strategies for clinical treatment of temporal lobe epilepsy.","scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Life Sciences"],"handles":[],"subjects":["cellbiology","biochemistry"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6103cf058f610006e13","isbns":[],"authors":["Qu, Zhengyi","Su, Fang","Qi, Xueting","Sun, Jianbo","Wang, Hongcai","Qiao, Zhenkui","Zhao, Hong","Zhu, Yulan"],"pmid":"29052243","issns":["1099-0844"],"type":"article","journal":"Cell Biochemistry and Function","pubdate":"2017-10-19T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1508582168},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Wnt publications","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/867065609405833216\/3jto4N3b_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"866558175335649280","followers":91,"id_on_source":"WntPublications","geo":{"ln":null,"lt":null},"description":"Twitterbot on Wnt signaling pathway publications #Wnt #PubMed"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/WntPublications\/statuses\/921686532892667905","citation_ids":[27741489],"tweet_id":"921686532892667905","posted_on":"2017-10-21T10:36:08+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0.25,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":409,"total_number_of_other_articles":457,"sample_size":457,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":1.8298201754},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":8471967,"total_number_of_other_articles":9711563,"sample_size":9711563,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":7.5135481761},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":223349,"total_number_of_other_articles":268491,"sample_size":268491,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":12.5547170397},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":7,"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"sample_size":13,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":1.4583333333}}},"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["WntPublications"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":2,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":27741489}

Propane-1,2-diol was found to be the least toxic cryoprotectant when compared with DMSO and methanol. Both propane-1,2-diol and DMSO are effective in protecting cells from freezing damage. Whilst there were no significant differences in cell survival between cryoprotectant concentration (10 or 15%) and culture age used in this study, 7-day old culture appeared to be more resistant to freezing without cryoprotectant when compared with 3- and 14-day old culture. The highest cell survival values obtained with propane-1,2-diol (10%) and DMSO (10%) protection were 96.2 1.2% and 94.0 3.1% respectively. Initial subsequent cell growth after cryopreservation was slower than their non-frozen controls. The survival of transfected BF-2 cells (BF-2\/luc1) after cryopreservation were very similar to those obtained with wild type cells being: 94.0 3.1% and 95.2 1.5% respectively with 10% DMSO protection. These results suggested that genetically modified fish cell lines may be equally amenable to cryopreservation as the wild type.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6133cf058f610007031","authors":["Zhang, Tiantian","Rawson, David M"],"first_seen_on":"2016-04-27T17:43:50+00:00","issns":["0143-2044"],"issue":"3","journal":"Cryoletters","pmid":"12148022","pubdate":"2002-05-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Other Biological Sciences","scheme":"era"},{"name":"Medical Physiology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Medicine","Life Sciences","Agricultural and Biological Sciences"],"subjects":["chemistry","biology"],"title":"Studies on cryopreservation of luc gene transfected bluegill sunfish fibroblast cell line.","type":"article","volume":"23"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":[],"posts":[]}

The objective of this study was to determine the disposition of TCDD in maternal and fetal Long-Evans (LE) rats following subchronic exposure, since the adverse reproductive and developmental effects have been extensively characterized in this strain of rat. LE rats were dosed by gavage with 1, 10, or 30 ng [(3)H]TCDD\/kg in corn oil, 5 days\/week for 13 weeks. At the end of 13 weeks, females were mated and dosing continued every day throughout gestation. Dams were sacrificed on gestation day (GD) 9, GD16, GD21, and post-natal day 4 and analyzed for [(3)H]TCDD-derived activity in maternal and fetal tissues. Maternal body burdens were equivalent at different time points, indicating that the dams were at steady state. Maternal body burdens were approximately 19, 120, and 300 ng TCDD\/kg following doses of 1, 10, and 30 ng TCDD\/kg, respectively. Individual embryo concentrations on GD9 were 1.6, 7, and 16 pg TCDD\/g after maternal exposure of 1, 10, and 30 ng\/kg\/d, respectively. On GD 16, fetal liver, urogenital tract, head, and body concentrations were similar and averaged 1.4, 7.8, and 16.4 pg TCDD\/g after administration of 1, 10, or 30 ng TCDD\/kg\/d, respectively, indicating no preferential sequestration within the different fetal tissues. These concentrations of TCDD within fetal tissues after subchronic exposure are comparable to those seen after a single dose of 50, 200, or 1000 ng TCDD\/kg administered on GD15, a critical period of gestation.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5153cf058f610003678","authors":["Christopher H.

Often groups of labour market participants, such as young workers, recent immigrants or temporary workers are labelled as being \"vulnerable\" to work injury. However, defining groups in this way does little to enable a better understanding of the broader factors that place workers at increased risk of injury. In this paper we describe the development of a new measure of occupational health and safety (OH&S) vulnerability. The purpose of this measure was to allow the identification of workers at increased risk of injury, and to enable the monitoring and surveillance of OH&S vulnerability in the labour market. The development included a systematic literature search, and conducting focus groups with a variety of stakeholder groups, to generate a pool of potential items, followed by a series of steps to reduce these items to a more manageable pool. The final measure is 29-item instrument that captures information on four related, but distinct dimensions, thought to be associated with increased risk of injury. These dimensions are: hazard exposure; occupational health and safety policies and procedures; OH&S awareness; and empowerment to participate in injury prevention. In a large sample of employees in Ontario and British Columbia the final measure displayed minimal missing responses, reasonably good distributions across response categories, and strong factorial validity. This new measure of OH&S vulnerability can identify workers who are at risk of injury and provide information on the dimensions of work that may increase this risk. This measurement could be undertaken at one point in time to compare vulnerability across groups, or be undertaken at multiple time points to examine changes in dimensions of OH&S vulnerability, for example, in response to a primary prevention intervention.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Public Health And Health Services"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Transportation And Freight Services"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Psychology"}],"volume":"82","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-conceptual-model-selfreported-measure-occupational-health-safety-vulnerability","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e73cf058f61000213e","scopus_subjects":["Health Sciences","Physical Sciences","Social Sciences","Medicine","Engineering"],"isbns":[],"authors":["Smith, Peter M","Saunders, Ron","Lifshen, Marni","Black, Ollie","Lay, Morgan","Breslin, F Curtis","LaMontagne, Anthony D","Tompa, Emile"],"startpage":"234","pmid":"26103437","issns":["1879-2057","00014575"],"type":"article","journal":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","pubdate":"2015-06-24T22:00:29+00:00","endpage":"243"},"posts":{"news":[{"license":"public","title":"Inquiries into migrant worker rights show same old problems \u2013 but we already have solutions","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22785492181&p=1pl&v=1&x=aTXqoby2jhowkor9-aGPxw","author":{"url":"http:\/\/theconversation.com","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/071\/normal\/the_conversation.png?1369846953","name":"The Conversation"},"summary":"A Senate inquiry into exploitation and underpayment of foreign workers at 7-Eleven stores began in Melbourne today.","citation_ids":[4546819,4206770],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T05:21:25+00:00"},{"license":"public","title":"Inquiries into migrant worker rights show same old problems \u2013 but we already have solutions","url":"http:\/\/ct.moreover.com\/?a=22787243740&p=1pl&v=1&x=JqDzdp-FpSCXA2Jo6kua-w","author":{"url":"http:\/\/healthmedicinet.com\/","image":"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/weyland.altmetric.com\/news_sources\/logos\/000\/000\/942\/normal\/image.png?1402915110","name":"Health Medicinet"},"summary":"A Senate inquiry into exploitation and underpayment of foreign workers at 7-Eleven stores began in Melbourne today.","citation_ids":[4546819,4206770],"posted_on":"2015-09-24T08:46:34+00:00"}],"twitter":[{"license":"datasift","author":{"name":"Tom Heston","url":"http:\/\/tomheston.com","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/972254674886766597\/zJEq6uly_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"21013461","followers":80228,"id_on_source":"tomheston","geo":{"ln":17.83333,"country":"BA","lt":44.25},"description":"I help people make wise health decisions.
