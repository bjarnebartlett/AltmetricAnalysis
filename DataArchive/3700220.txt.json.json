We also examined early (age 3) and concurrent (age 6) child behavioral, self-regulatory, and social characteristics as predictors of age 6 STR quality. Children with ID experienced significantly poorer relationships with their teachers, marked by less closeness and more conflict and dependency, compared to typically-developing children. This group difference was not accounted for entirely by IQ differences. The relation between ID status and STR quality was fully mediated by four age 6 child variables: mother- and teacher-reported behavior problems and mother- and teacher-reported social skills. The quality of children's relationships with teachers was also predicted by child characteristics as early as age 3, including early behavior problems, self-regulation, and behavior during parent-child interactions. The relation of ID status to STR quality at age 6 was fully mediated by children's self-regulatory abilities at age 3. Our findings demonstrate the importance of child behavioral and social characteristics in predicting relationships with teachers for children with and without ID.","abstract_source":"pubmed","last_mentioned_on":1337522486,"pubdate":"2007-08-01T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Early Student-Teacher Relationships of Children With and Without Intellectual Disability: Contributions of Behavioral, Social, and Self-Regulatory Competence","scopus_subjects":["Psychology","Social Sciences"],"subjects":["education","psychology"],"startpage":"363","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4f63cf058f610002f11","pmid":"21490876","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/early-studentteacher-relationships-children-without-intellectual-disability-contributions-behavioral","first_seen_on":"2012-04-28T03:03:53+00:00","journal":"Journal of School Psychology","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Specialist Studies In Education"},{"scheme":"era","name":"Psychology"}],"volume":"45","authors":["Abbey S.

Few studies have used noninvasive techniques to measure epidermis function in asymptomatic neonates.\nData of 116 infants from our previous randomized controlled study were analyzed. Skin barrier function was measured through transepidermal water loss (TEWL), stratum corneum hydration (SCH), and pH. The association between skin barrier function and time to AD development was evaluated. Patients were classified with high or low TEWL, and SCH and pH were assessed. The survival function of the time to AD development and hazard ratios were estimated. Allergic sensitization to egg white and ovomucoid at 32 weeks was assessed.\nRegardless of a filaggrin mutation, TEWL (optimal cutoff, 6.5\u00a0g\/m(2)\/h) of the forehead within the first week of life showed a lower p-value than TEWL of the leg, and the SCH and pH measurements. Baseline TEWL of the forehead was not different between groups, except for the mean gestational age, and it was not affected by humidity. We found a significant difference in the cumulative AD incidence between the high and low TEWL groups for the forehead only (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05). The probability without AD was lower in the high TEWL group than in the low TEWL group. For only the high TEWL group, AD development decreased significantly with daily emollient use. The high TEWL group exhibited a higher rate of sensitization to ovomucoid (p\u00a0=\u00a00.07).\nTEWL of the forehead during the first week of life is associated with AD development.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4e83cf058f6100021d2","authors":["Kenta Horimukai","Kumiko Morita","Masami Narita","Mai Kondo","Shigenori Kabashima","Eisuke Inoue","Takashi Sasaki","Hironori Niizeki","Hirohisa Saito","Kenji Matsumoto","Yukihiro Ohya"],"doi":"10.1016\/j.alit.2015.09.004","first_seen_on":"2018-05-23T00:08:50+00:00","issns":["13238930"],"issue":"1","journal":"Allergology International","last_mentioned_on":1504541078,"links":["http:\/\/dx.doi.org\/10.1016\/j.alit.2015.09.004"],"pmid":"26666481","pubdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Immunology","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["allergyandimmunology"],"title":"Transepidermal water loss measurement during infancy can predict the subsequent development of atopic dermatitis regardless of filaggrin mutations","type":"article","volume":"65","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/transepidermal-water-loss-measurement-during-infancy-predict-subsequent-development-atopic-dermatiti"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":3,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10782532,"mean":7.2824290257917,"rank":2886283,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":52,"this_scored_higher_than":5624076,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10782532,"percentile":52},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":98199,"mean":12.050758487953,"rank":31719,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":67,"this_scored_higher_than":65848,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":98199,"percentile":67},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":397,"mean":2.8439646464646,"rank":87,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":271,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":397,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"mean":0,"rank":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1,"percentile":1}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":2,"Professor > Associate Professor":4,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.

To serve as a context, we provide an overview of the Sustainable Development Goals as they relate to violence prevention by including a summary of key documents informing violence prevention efforts by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Violence Prevention Alliance (VPA) partners. After consultation with the United Nations (UN) Inter-Agency Expert Group on Sustainable Development Goal Indicators (IAEG-SDG), we select specific targets and indicators, featuring them in a summary table. Using the diverse expertise of the authors, we assign attributes that characterize the focus and nature of these indicators. We hope that this will serve as a preliminary framework for understanding these accountability metrics.

The biological process is composed of two reactors connected in series. Each reactor has been designed to stimulate the growth of Bacillus sp., spore-forming aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria. As a consequence, the population of Bacillus sp. is aptly increased via the cycle of sporulation, germination and proliferation. With a predominant growth of Bacillus sp., the microbial activity has been increased comparing to activated sludge based on the result of measuring specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR). This process was able to remove nitrogen and phosphorus as well as organic matter efficiently. More than 98% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and chemical oxygen demand (COD) were removed. In term of removing the total nitrogen (T-N), about 98% of this was reduced. On average, the T-N concentration in the feed was 3,270 mg\/l but 74 mg\/l in the effluent including 30 mg\/l of nitrite and nitrate nitrogen. The total phosphorus (T-P) reduction averaged 87.5%. As a result, it would be advantageous to load this process in order to deal with high-strength wastewater.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa53c3cf058f610004715","authors":["Choi, Y S","Hong, S W","Kim, S J","Chung, I H"],"first_seen_on":"2018-04-06T04:47:02+00:00","issns":["0273-1223"],"issue":"12","journal":"Water Science & Technology","last_mentioned_on":1242950400,"links":["http:\/\/www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\/pubmed\/12201129"],"pmid":"12201129","pubdate":"2002-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["Environmental Science","Physical Sciences"],"subjects":["environmentalhealth"],"title":"Development of a biological process for livestock wastewater treatment using a technique for predominant outgrowth of Bacillus species.","type":"article","volume":"45","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/development-biological-process-livestock-wastewater-treatment-using-technique-predominant-outgrowth"},"altmetric_score":{"score":3,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":3},"context_for_score":{"all":{"total_number_of_other_articles":9597649,"mean":7.4858835600017,"rank":2569080,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":57,"this_scored_higher_than":5533037,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":9597649,"percentile":57},"similar_age_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":100316,"mean":12.919379454718,"rank":33975,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":65,"this_scored_higher_than":65620,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":100316,"percentile":65},"this_journal":{"total_number_of_other_articles":1082,"mean":1.9859703977798,"rank":97,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":68,"this_scored_higher_than":746,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":1082,"percentile":68},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"total_number_of_other_articles":10,"mean":2.2777777777778,"rank":3,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":70,"this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank_type":"exact","sample_size":10,"percentile":70}}},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Unspecified":1,"Professor > Associate Professor":1,"Researcher":3,"Student  > Ph.

Silencing and methylation of certain sites on one of the two alleles in somatic cells is specific with respect to parental source for imprinted genes and random for X-linked genes. We report here evidence indicating that: (i) differential methylation patterns of imprinted genes are not simply copied from the gametes, but rather established gradually after fertilization; (ii) very similar methylation patterns are observed for diploid, tetraploid, parthenogenic, and androgenic preimplantation mouse embryos, as well as parthenogenic and androgenic mouse embryonic stem cells; (iii) haploid parthenogenic embryos do not show methylation adjustment as seen in diploid or tetraploid embryos, but rather retain the maternal pattern. These observations suggest that differential methylation in imprinted genes is achieved by a dynamic process that senses gene dosage and adjusts methylation similar to X-chromosome inactivation.","ads_id":"1996PNAS...93.6371S","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5133cf058f6100033a0","authors":["Shemer, R","Birger, Y","Dean, W L","Reik, W","Riggs, A D","Razin, A"],"doi":"10.1073\/pnas.93.13.6371","endpage":"6376","first_seen_on":"2016-02-12T02:19:55+00:00","issns":["0027-8424","1091-6490"],"issue":"13","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","pmcid":"PMC39029","pmid":"8692822","pubdate":"1996-06-25T00:00:00+00:00","publisher_subjects":[{"name":"Multidisciplinary","scheme":"era"}],"scopus_subjects":["General"],"startpage":"6371","subjects":["science"],"title":"Dynamic methylation adjustment and counting as part of imprinting mechanisms.","type":"article","volume":"93","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/dynamic-methylation-adjustment-counting-part-imprinting-mechanisms"},"altmetric_score":{"score":0,"score_history":{"1y":0,"6m":0,"3m":0,"1m":0,"1w":0,"6d":0,"5d":0,"4d":0,"3d":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"at":0},"context_for_score":null},"demographics":{"users":{"mendeley":{"by_status":{"Professor > Associate Professor":3,"Researcher":7,"Student  > Doctoral Student":1,"Student  > Ph.

However, recent evidence demonstrates that poor nutritional status in critically ill obese patients confounds this relationship. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate if poor nutritional status, poor food intake and adverse health-related outcomes have a demonstrated association in non-critically ill obese acute care hospital patients.\nThis is a secondary analysis of the Australasian Nutrition Care Day Survey dataset (N\u00a0=\u00a03122), a prospective cohort study conducted in hospitals from Australia and New Zealand in 2010. At baseline, hospital dietitians recorded participants' BMI, evaluated nutritional status using Subjective Global Assessment (SGA), and recorded 24-h\u00a0food intake (as 0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% of the offered food). Post-three months, participants' length of stay (LOS), readmissions, and in-hospital mortality data were collected. Bivariate and regression analyses were conducted to investigate if there were an association between BMI, nutritional status, poor food intake, and health-related outcomes.\nOf the 3122 participants, 2889 (93%) had eligible data. Obesity was prevalent in 26% of the cohort (n\u00a0=\u00a0750; 75% females; 61\u00a0\u00b1\u00a015 years; 37\u00a0\u00b1\u00a07\u00a0kg\/m2). Fourteen percent (n\u00a0=\u00a0105) of the obese patients were malnourished. Over a quarter of the malnourished obese patients (N\u00a0=\u00a030\/105, 28%) consumed \u226425% of the offered meals. Most malnourished obese patients (74\/105, 70%) received standard diets without additional nutritional support. After controlling for confounders (age, disease type and severity), malnutrition and intake \u226425% of the offered meals independently trebled the odds of in-hospital mortality within 90 days of hospital admission in obese patients.\nAlthough malnourished obese experienced significantly adverse health-related outcomes they were least likely to receive additional nutritional support. This study demonstrates that BMI alone cannot be used as a surrogate measure for nutritional status and warrants routine nutritional screening for all hospital patients, and subsequent nutritional assessment and support for malnourished patients.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Nutrition And Dietetics"}],"handles":[],"subjects":["nutritionalsciences"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa5e63cf058f61000580d","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences","Nursing"],"isbns":[],"authors":["Ekta Agarwal","Maree Ferguson","Merrilyn Banks","Angela Vivanti","Marijka Batterham","Judy Bauer","Sandra Capra","Elisabeth Isenring"],"pmid":"29559233","issns":["02615614","1532-1983"],"type":"article","journal":"Clinical Nutrition","pubdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1526712525},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Ekta Agarwal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/811851254548697088\/lgAJLnoE_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"3192304993","followers":263,"id_on_source":"DrEktAgarwal","geo":{"ln":153.02809,"country":"AU","lt":-27.46794},"description":"Accredited Practising Dietitian, researcher, lecturer, mum, vegetarian, spicy food lover"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrEktAgarwal\/statuses\/975501696112648192","citation_ids":[34491517],"tweet_id":"975501696112648192","posted_on":"2018-03-18T22:38:22+00:00"},{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Ekta Agarwal","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/811851254548697088\/lgAJLnoE_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"3192304993","followers":263,"id_on_source":"DrEktAgarwal","geo":{"ln":153.02809,"country":"AU","lt":-27.46794},"description":"Accredited Practising Dietitian, researcher, lecturer, mum, vegetarian, spicy food lover"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/DrEktAgarwal\/statuses\/975501698335567872","citation_ids":[34491517],"tweet_id":"975501698335567872","posted_on":"2018-03-18T22:38:23+00:00"},{"rt":["DrEktAgarwal"],"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Harri\u00ebt Jager","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Harriet_Jager-Wittenaar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/698247468572635138\/LzH0lWQw_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"1695084205","followers":828,"id_on_source":"HarrietJager","geo":{"ln":6.75,"country":"NL","lt":53.25},"description":"Prof. (Lector) Clinical Malnutrition & Healthy Ageing @Hanze \u2726 Sr. Researcher @UMCG \u2726 Coordinates research on proactive prevention & treatment of malnutrition"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HarrietJager\/statuses\/975509726409654272","citation_ids":[34491517],"tweet_id":"975509726409654272","posted_on":"2018-03-18T23:10:17+00:00"},{"rt":["DrEktAgarwal"],"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Harri\u00ebt Jager","url":"https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/profile\/Harriet_Jager-Wittenaar","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/698247468572635138\/LzH0lWQw_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"1695084205","followers":828,"id_on_source":"HarrietJager","geo":{"ln":6.75,"country":"NL","lt":53.25},"description":"Prof. (Lector) Clinical Malnutrition & Healthy Ageing @Hanze \u2726 Sr. Researcher @UMCG \u2726 Coordinates research on proactive prevention & treatment of malnutrition"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/HarrietJager\/statuses\/975509754909995009","citation_ids":[34491517],"tweet_id":"975509754909995009","posted_on":"2018-03-18T23:10:24+00:00"},{"rt":["DrEktAgarwal"],"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Adrienne Young AdvAPD","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/560559021669613568\/q6VW8XSS_normal.jpeg","tweeter_id":"2444821813","followers":425,"id_on_source":"dr_am_young","geo":{"ln":153.02809,"country":"AU","lt":-27.46794},"description":"Advanced Accredited Practicing Dietitian, PhD.

Sixty silver fox vixens were selected randomly and artificially inseminated. Cabergoline was fed to groups of 12 vixens in a minced beef ration either as a single dose of 25, 50 or 100 microg kg(-1), or a dose of 50 microg kg(-1) that was repeated 2 days later (2 x 50 microg kg(-1)). Four foxes from each group of 12 were given cabergoline at day 28, day 35 or day 48 after artificial insemination, and a control group of four foxes was used as a comparison for each dose day. In a separate trial, two groups of five foxes were selected randomly from the farm population and fed 100 microg kg(-1) of either cabergoline or a placebo each day from day 42 to day 46 of pregnancy. Foxes that received single doses of cabergoline of 100 microg kg(-1) or 2 x 50 microg kg(-1) aborted at day 28, but the same doses did not result in abortions when administered on days 35 and 48. Although lactation was not terminated in groups that received a single or double dose of cabergoline, increased post-natal cub mortality was associated with cabergoline administration. Growth of cubs between 4 and 8 weeks of age was not inhibited in vixens that received cabergoline. Doses of 100 microg cabergoline kg(-1) administered each day from day 42 to day 46 resulted in abortions and terminated lactation. The capacity of single doses of cabergoline to cause abortions in the red fox during mid- rather than late pregnancy is contrary to reported observations for the domestic dog. This finding indicates that luteotrophic support of the corpus luteum by prolactin may be more important at mid-pregnancy in the red fox. The results of this study support previous field observations that cabergoline delivered in bait affects the reproductive success of vixens and may be a practical adjunct to the lethal control of wild red foxes in Australia.","altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6363cf058f610008738","authors":["Marks, C A","Jalkanen, L","Savolainen, R","Short, R V","C.

We evaluated twelve tagging single-nucleotide polymorphisms (tSNPs) of the PNPLA3 gene in a frequency matched case-control study from Fuzhou city of China (553 cases, 553 controls). In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the rs738409 GG or GC, and rs139051 TT genotypes were found to be associated with increased risk of NAFLD, and a significant trend of increased risk with increasing numbers of risk genotype was observed in the cumulative effect analysis of these single nucleotide polymorphisms. Furthermore, haplotype association analysis showed that, compared with the most common haplotype, the CAAGAATGCGTG and CGAAGGTGTCCG haplotypes conferred a statistically significant increased risk for NAFLD, while the CGGGAACCCGCG haplotype decreased the risk of NAFLD. Moreover, rs738409 C>G appeared to have a multiplicative joint effect with tea drinking (P<0.005) and an additive joint effect with obesity (Interaction contrast ratio (ICR)\u200a=\u200a2.31, 95% CI: 0.7-8.86), hypertriglyceridemia (ICR\u200a=\u200a3.07, 95% CI: 0.98-5.09) or hypertension (ICR\u200a=\u200a1.74, 95% CI: 0.52-3.12).
