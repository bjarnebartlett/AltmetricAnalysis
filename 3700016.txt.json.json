It is of interest to make an analysis of the radionuclide composition of the fallout following the both accidents. The results of the spectrometric measurements were used in that comparative analysis. Two areas following the Chernobyl accident were considered: (1) the near zone of the fallout - the Belarusian part of the central spot extended up to 60 km around the Chernobyl NPS and (2) the far zone of the fallout--the \"Gomel-Mogilev\" spot centered 200 km to the north-northeast of the damaged reactor. In the case of Fukushima accident the near zone up to about 60 km considered. The comparative analysis has been done with respect to refractory radionuclides (95Zr, 95Nb, 141Ce, 144Ce), as well as to the intermediate and volatile radionuclides 103Ru, 106Ru, 131I, 134Cs, 137Cs, 140La, 140Ba and the results of such a comparison have been discussed. With respect to exposure to the public the most important radionuclides are 131I and 137Cs. For the both accidents the ratios of 131I\/137Cs in the considered soil samples are in the similar ranges: (3-50) for the Chernobyl samples and (5-70) for the Fukushima samples. Similarly to the Chernobyl accident a clear tendency that the ratio of 131I\/137Cs in the fallout decreases with the increase of the ground deposition density of 137Cs within the trace related to a radioactive cloud has been identified for the Fukushima accident. It looks like this is a universal tendency for the ratio of 131I\/137Cs versus the 137Cs ground deposition density in the fallout along the trace of a radioactive cloud as a result of a heavy accident at the NPP with radionuclides releases into the environment. This tendency is important for an objective reconstruction of 131I fallout based on the results of 137Cs measurements of soil samples carried out at late dates after the Fukushima accident.","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"subjects":["occupationalmedicine"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa9223cf058f61000da0d","abstract_source":"pubmed","authors":["K V Kotenko","S M Shinkarev","Iu V Abramov","E O Granovskaia","V N Iatsenko","Iu I Gavrilin","U Ia Margulis","O S Garetskaia","T Imanaka","M Khoshi"],"pmid":"23210176","issns":["1026-9428"],"issue":"10","journal":"Meditsina truda i promyshlennaia ekologiia","pubdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1388825627},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"public","author":{"name":"#DenialNoMore","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1836-Letters-Patent-Treaty-717307385093497\/?ref=bookmarks","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/3160322596\/88606b99f9689e2de34576df32f367b2_normal.jpeg","tweeter_id":"1118788734","followers":571,"id_on_source":"SALettersPatent","geo":{"ln":137.60486,"country":"AU","lt":-35.01845},"description":"Recognition Respect Rights Reform Responsibility Reciprocity Reparation - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/groups\/125618700941212\/?ref=bookmarks"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/SALettersPatent\/status\/419391196939558912","citation_ids":[2019991],"tweet_id":"419391196939558912","posted_on":"2014-01-04T08:53:47+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":1,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":1,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":7,"rank":1,"total_number_of_other_articles":13,"sample_size":13,"percentile":53,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":53,"mean":0.5208333333},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":940245,"rank":2015930,"total_number_of_other_articles":3629660,"sample_size":3629660,"percentile":25,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":25,"mean":4.9331369641},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":31187,"rank":55798,"total_number_of_other_articles":111123,"sample_size":111123,"percentile":28,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":28,"mean":7.2076773276},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":1,"total_number_of_other_articles":1,"sample_size":1,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":0}}},"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["SALettersPatent"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":1,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":2019991}

While protein-encoding genes have been relatively well-annotated in sequenced genomes, accounting for a small portion of the genome space in plants, the universe of plant ncRNAs is rapidly expanding. Recent advances in experimental and computational technologies have generated a great momentum for discovery and functional characterization of ncRNAs. Here we summarize the classification and known biological functions of plant ncRNAs, review the application of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology and ribosome profiling technology to ncRNA discovery in horticultural plants and discuss the application of new technologies, especially the new genome-editing tool clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)\/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (Cas9) systems, to functional characterization of plant ncRNAs.","last_mentioned_on":1501049400,"pubdate":"2017-07-05T00:00:00+00:00","title":"New technologies accelerate the exploration of non-coding RNAs in horticultural plants","handles":[],"altmetric_jid":"5301ee633cf0581d5b8b4567","startpage":"hortres201731","pmid":"28698797","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/new-technologies-accelerate-exploration-noncoding-rnas-horticultural-plants","first_seen_on":"2017-07-05T06:45:01+00:00","journal":"Horticulture Research","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"npg","name":"Plant sciences"},{"scheme":"npg","name":"Genomics"}],"volume":"4","authors":["Degao Liu","Ritesh Mewalal","Rongbin Hu","Gerald A Tuskan","Xiaohan Yang","Liu, Degao","Mewalal, Ritesh","Hu, Rongbin","Tuskan, Gerald A","Yang, Xiaohan"],"pmcid":"PMC5496985","publisher":"Nature Publishing Group","doi":"10.1038\/hortres.2017.31","pdf_url":"http:\/\/www.nature.com\/articles\/hortres201731.pdf","issns":["2052-7276"]},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"AFOLABI LUKMAN","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/lukman-olalekan-afolabi-041b4119\/","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/1320420665\/pass2_normal.JPG","tweeter_id":"285869056","followers":741,"id_on_source":"saintlukman","geo":{"ln":3.75,"country":"NG","lt":6.58333},"description":"Early career researcher with a background in cell and molecular biology.

It plays a critical role in host defense, clearing and slowing the infection in the case of microbial invasion. During an inflammatory response, a variety of cytokines are produced by cells and trigger or enhance the specific inflammation response. TNF\u03b1, one of these factors, plays a crucial role in many immune and inflammatory processes, such as proliferation, apoptosis, necrosis, and cell survival. It acts in orchestrating the cytokine cascade and the major regulator of inflammatory cytokine production. Abnormality of TNF\u03b1 signaling leads to many diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, Crohn's disease, atherosclerosis, and cancer. Due to the importance of TNF\u03b1, regulating TNF\u03b1 activity is a key to treat the related diseases. There is a long history of using medicinal herbs to treat diseases related to inflammation. We searched for an ingredient that has the ability to inhibit TNF\u03b1, we examined AO herbal extract, containing 10 individual herbs and most of these herbs have anti-inflammatory activity within humans. We have tested the anti-inflammatory ability of AO herbal extract on mice. Furthermore, we used macrophage cell from young mice and found that AO extract has the ability to reduce the inflammation by inhibiting TNF\u03b1 level.","first_seen_on":"2016-02-03T08:22:51+00:00","pubdate":"2016-02-03T22:19:37+00:00","title":"Identification of inflammatory factor TNF\u03b1 inhibitor from medicinal herbs ","scopus_subjects":["Biochemistry, Genetics and Molecular Biology","Health Sciences","Life Sciences","Medicine"],"subjects":["molecularbiology","pathology"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa4eb3cf058f61000288e","startpage":"307","pmid":"26778692","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/identification-inflammatory-factor-tnf%CE%B1-inhibitor-medicinal-herbs","last_mentioned_on":1485369030,"journal":"Experimental & Molecular Pathology","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Clinical Sciences"}],"volume":"100","authors":["Ye, Hong","Wang, Yali","Bennett Jenson, A","Yan, Jun"],"endpage":"311","doi":"10.1016\/j.yexmp.2015.12.014","issue":"2","issns":["1096-0945","00144800"]},"posts":{"reddit":[{"license":"public","author":{"id_on_source":"badbiosvictim1"},"url":"http:\/\/www.reddit.com\/r\/Electromagnetics\/comments\/45thyi\/j_inflammation_treatments_cancer_treatments\/","title":"[J] [Inflammation: Treatments] [Cancer: Treatments] Identification of inflammatory factor TNF\u03b1 inhibitor from medicinal herbs.","citation_ids":[5082038],"posted_on":"2016-02-14T22:57:32+00:00"}],"facebook":[{"license":"public","title":"Identification of inflammatory factor TNF\u03b1 inhibitor from medicinal herbs. - PubMed - NCBI","url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/permalink.php?story_fbid=1221591724546195&id=634432799928760","author":{"url":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/634432799928760","facebook_wall_name":"Earthblends","image":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/634432799928760\/picture","id_on_source":"634432799928760","name":"EarthBlends"},"summary":"Curious about the science behind our patches?

Diagnostic evaluation revealed multiple potential underlying etiologies and contributing factors, with alloimmunity to HLA antigens determined to be the most probable cause after thorough laboratory investigation.","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Medical And Health Sciences"}],"volume":"168","subjects":["medicine"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa62a3cf058f610007ed3","scopus_subjects":["Medicine","Health Sciences"],"authors":["Vora Md, Moiz","Ong Md, Menchu","Al-Delfi Md, Firas","Cruz Md, Nestor Dela","Veillon Md, Diana","Cotelingam Md, James"],"pmid":"26986860","issns":["0024-6921"],"issue":"1","journal":"Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society","pubdate":"2016-03-18T22:00:11+00:00","last_mentioned_on":1458296472},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Cancer Papers","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/610454165983244288\/dcwghekI_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"3326766226","followers":828,"id_on_source":"CancerPapers","geo":{"ln":null,"lt":null},"description":"Stay abreast of the latest developments in the fight against cancer with daily publications curated from PubMed."},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/CancerPapers\/statuses\/710773037285580800","citation_ids":[6228801],"tweet_id":"710773037285580800","posted_on":"2016-03-18T10:21:12+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.5,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.5,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":32,"rank":41,"total_number_of_other_articles":82,"sample_size":82,"percentile":39,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":39,"mean":1.5260246914},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":996294,"rank":5604750,"total_number_of_other_articles":7408484,"sample_size":7408484,"percentile":13,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":13,"mean":6.4406978049},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":43511,"rank":196453,"total_number_of_other_articles":279899,"sample_size":279899,"percentile":15,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":15,"mean":10.8421406441},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":2,"rank":1,"total_number_of_other_articles":4,"sample_size":4,"percentile":50,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":50,"mean":0.3333333333}}},"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["CancerPapers"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":1,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":6228801}

An entrapped internal unit, created by a ship-in-a-bottle assembly, was connected to an external unit via a pre-attached linker threaded through a nanopore in the shell of the nanocapsule. Successful synthesis was achieved with fairly short linkers (six and ten carbon atoms in a chain), creating an opportunity for facile synthesis of functional devices capable of cross-shell communication.","first_seen_on":"2016-08-16T15:35:01+00:00","pubdate":"2016-08-16T00:00:00+00:00","title":"Rotaxane-Like Structures Threaded through the Pores of Hollow Porous Nanocapusles","scopus_subjects":["Physical Sciences","Chemistry"],"subjects":["chemistry"],"altmetric_jid":"4f6fa6113cf058f610006e57","startpage":"14137","pmid":"27471052","type":"article","mendeley_url":"http:\/\/www.mendeley.com\/research\/rotaxanelike-structures-threaded-through-pores-hollow-porous-nanocapusles","last_mentioned_on":1471361684,"journal":"Chemistry - A European Journal","publisher_subjects":[{"scheme":"era","name":"Chemical Sciences"}],"volume":"22","authors":["Dergunov, Sergey A.","Ehterami, Nasim","Pinkhassik, Eugene"],"endpage":"14140","doi":"10.1002\/chem.201602731","issue":"40","pdf_url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/doi\/10.1002\/chem.201602731\/pdf","isbns":[],"issns":["1521-3765"]},"posts":{"twitter":[{"license":"gnip","author":{"name":"Chemistry","url":"http:\/\/onlinelibrary.wiley.com\/journal\/10.1002\/(ISSN)1521-3765","image":"https:\/\/pbs.twimg.com\/profile_images\/669149218846720000\/C7lWCugX_normal.jpg","tweeter_id":"1522831152","followers":4358,"id_on_source":"ChemEurJ","geo":{"ln":8.66697,"country":"DE","lt":49.54887},"description":"Chemistry - A European Journal\r\nMultidisciplinary Chemistry Journal from ChemPubSoc Europe"},"url":"http:\/\/twitter.com\/ChemEurJ\/statuses\/765572509236334593","citation_ids":[10554168],"tweet_id":"765572509236334593","posted_on":"2016-08-16T15:34:44+00:00"}]},"altmetric_score":{"score":0.25,"score_history":{"6d":0,"1w":0,"1y":0,"6m":0,"2d":0,"1d":0,"3m":0,"at":0.25,"5d":0,"4d":0,"1m":0,"3d":0},"context_for_score":{"this_journal":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":4407,"total_number_of_other_articles":6110,"sample_size":6110,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":3.123866754},"all":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":7116958,"total_number_of_other_articles":8223523,"sample_size":8223523,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":6.9683458336},"similar_age_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":198043,"total_number_of_other_articles":233174,"sample_size":233174,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":12.3889539098},"similar_age_this_journal_3m":{"rank_type":"exact","this_scored_higher_than":0,"rank":230,"total_number_of_other_articles":342,"sample_size":342,"percentile":1,"this_scored_higher_than_pct":1,"mean":3.6560762463}}},"counts":{"twitter":{"posts_count":1,"unique_users":["ChemEurJ"],"unique_users_count":1},"total":{"posts_count":1},"readers":{"mendeley":10,"citeulike":0,"connotea":0}},"altmetric_id":10554168}
